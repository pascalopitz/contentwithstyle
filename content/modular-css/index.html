<h1>Modular CSS</h1>

<div class="info clearfix">
    <p class="credit">by Mike Stenhouse on May 18 2005, 08:47</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
    <p>This isn't a new idea but looking at people's code it doesn't seem to be
a particularly widely used practice: modular CSS. That's a poncy name for
the very simple idea of grouping related styles into separate
stylesheets. The same set of tasks turn up on project after project and a
little careful thought can save hours of foundation work, allowing you to
get on with the serious business of turning a flat design into a web page
far more quickly.</p>

<p>The broad groups that I use are: typography, forms, layout, navigation
and colour. These aren't set in stone and some projects require more or
less categories.</p>

<h2>Common components</h2>

<h3>Typography:</h3>
<p>Basic styles for html elements with font faces, sizes, weights and
neutral colours. Bearing in mind that colour is dealt with elsewhere
you'll probably only find you need to make minor adjustments to these
between projects &ndash; a couple of ems here and there, bold to normal
for a heading or two, that sort of thing. I limit the styles in this
sheet to root elements only &ndash; no classes or ids. Anything requiring
a class is probably going to be site-sepcific and so belongs in layout.</p>

<h3>Forms:</h3>
<p>Forms are my least favourite things to try and style - the variation
between browsers often forces lots of ugly hacks and filters and I like
to keep these separate from the rest of the CSS.</p>

<h3>Navigation:</h3>
<p>How often have you coded a horizontal nav bar? Do it once, do it well,
and reuse it. You'll need to tweak a few bits and pieces but put it in
it's own CSS file and the bulk of the work will be a copy and paste away.</p>

<h3>Layout:</h3>
<p>This is where the majority of the work lies and most of it will be unique
to the project you're working on. I use naming conventions for my common
structural elements to ease the transition between sites when it come to
maintenance but that's off-topic for this article.</p>

<h3>Colour scheme:</h3>
<p>The only properties you'll need in here are: color, background and
border-color. Nothing else. Be sure to avoid adding any layout info here
&ndash; a misplaced margin:0 can ruin your whole afternoon!</p>
<p>An added benefit of the separate colour stylesheet is that you can write
yourself a nice neutral colour scheme and avoiding 10 hours per day of
staring at the eye-searing orange that your client is insisting on.</p>
<p>On a similar note: <a

<p>Possibly of interest here: <a
href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/black_and_white_day_five.html">
And All the Malarkey | Black and white: Day five</a>.</p>

<h2>Putting them all together</h2>
<p>I use a file called screen.css but it can be whatever you like. All
you're doing here is @importing your CSS modules to make up a complete
site. The @imports cover N4 degredation so you can just &lt;link&gt; to
screen.css from your HTML.</p>
<pre>
/* typography styles */
@import url("typo.css");

/* form elements */
@import url("forms.css");

/* main layout */
@import url("layout.css");

/* navigation */
@import url("horizontal-nav.css");

/* colour scheme */
@import url("skin.css");
</pre>
<p>For your print stylesheet you might choose to just import your
typography. Rather than having a print sheet that overrides all your
layout just have it import typo.css and nothing else. Job done. What
about handheld media types? Well you might want a flexible layout but the
same typography, form styling and colour scheme. Modular CSS comes to the
rescue and you only need to code a new layout and import it into
handheld.css along with typo.css, form.css and skin.css.</p>
<p>This technique also allows you to unplug stylesheets globally from your
site without having to touch the HTML, adding a layer of abstraction
between content and style.</p>
<p>Another happy side benefit of modular CSS is in the debugging &ndash;
just comment out whole stylesheets until you isolate the problem and
focus your efforts there.</p>
<h3>Addons:</h3>
<p>You could plug in a development stylesheet with Andrew Krespanis' Global
Whitespace Reset (<a
href="http://leftjustified.net/journal/2004/10/19/global-ws-reset">Left Justified | Global White Space Reset</a>).
Before you hand over just remove the import from screen.css and you're
good to go.</p>
<p>If you find that your're reusing chunks of code from previous projects
for promo boxes of headers, consider placing them in their own stylesheet
for easier access later.</p>
<h2>A word of caution</h2>
<p>The more stylesheets you have the more you, the developer, have to
remember and keep track of. Where did you set the padding on that
element? It could be in a number of places and if you're not used to your
system, or you're not consistent with it, things can get frustrating. Set
yourself some guidelines and stick to them to give yourself a fighting
chance of taking an educated guess at where you might have placed your
rules. Consider putting these guidelines in comments at the top of your
files &ndash; these can help to keep you on topic while you're coding as
well as setting you off running when you come to make maintenance changes
months down the line. Something as simple as sensible naming conventions
for your CSS files can be a great help.</p>

Having the CSS split into single modules makes sense if U consider that most &#8220;average&#8221; users turn on browser caching (or leave it turned on). <br />
<br />
So once loaded you can have the reusable parts cached and just pull in the changed parts. I like Mikes idea as well, but most times my approach is to split stuff into navigation, header, footer and typography, then exchange the content bit by using wrapper css files with @import.<br />
<br />
Any other thoughts on this?</div>

True enough, once the CSS is cached it makes no difference. The issue I see is the <em>initial</em> load time. I don&#8217;t think the importance of having the first load happen as quickly as possible can be understated.<br />
<br />
Another issue I see is the duplication of selectors. Having multiple instances of your selectors for every type of rule could add considerably to your overall CSS filesize.<br />
<br />
Both of these issues may be trivial when one considers HTTP pipelining, gzip compression, and all the other means we have to optimize HTTP connections, but if I can shave half a second off my initial load at the cost of less manageable CSS, I will. In the end it&#8217;s one of the thousands of tradeoffs that has to be made when designing a site.</div>

The point of the article is more the breaking down of your stylsheets into their functional parts than the recombination. <br />
<br />
The problem with putting everything back together on the server side is that you then can&#8217;t take advantage of client-side caching if you drop in other sheets on specific pages. I normally separate the home page layout from the rest of the layout, for example, because there&#8217;s no point serving it to every page. I also tend to swap layout sheets to switch between 2 column and 1 column page variations etc rather than switching on body id or the like. See my <a href="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/Articles/17/a-css-framework">CSS Framework</a> article&#8230; <br />
<br />
At the end of the day, what you do will depend on the requirements of the project and your personal preferences.</div>

Why would adding link @import elements to the head of your document for each CSS module prevent the browser from caching the stylesheets? The stylesheets themselves aren&#8217;t dynamic.</div>

On a side note, I recently wrote an article for Digital Web about dynamically generated CSS using PHP. That was the number one reaction by far: but dynamic CSS is slow, the browser doesn&#8217;t cache the results! First of all, unless your host is heavily loaded, generating something simple like CSS with a scripting language like PHP is almost as fast as a static file. And the &#8220;almost&#8221; bit is so trivial that no one would ever notice it unless you happen to run with snails. I&#8217;m even aware of situations when dynamic content is actually faster than a disk file. As far as the caching issue goes, that is trivial to fix.<br />

<div class="comment-text">Douglas: I think the misunderstanding was going back to Non&#8217;s post. He suggested using PHP to replace @import &#8211; making one long stylesheet to save on server requests. I&#8217;ve got no problem with generating stylesheets server-side, since these newfangled computer-thingies are alarmingly quick, but I&#8217;d favour a method that resulted in several sheets so that the common ones could be cached. <br />
<br />
The key benefit of this technique for me is the reusability though. I use my typo.css and forms.css sheets again and again between projects with only minimal changes. I&#8217;ve also got a tools sheet that contains classes for markupless clearing of floats, accessible hiding and image replacement, which I use over and over.</div>

Right, the comments regarding using PHP to generate CSS were an aside. On my site (for the most part) I only use PHP to generate the style element that @imports the various extra stylesheets: forms, tables, code, etc&#8230;very much in keeping with your article.<br />
<br />
I only brought up the topic of caching because as soon as many people hear &#8220;PHP&#8221; and &#8220;CSS&#8221; in the same sentence they all start in on how dynamic CSS is so slow. If done correctly, this is simply not the case. I guess preventing more misinformation was my goal with that post.<br />

I build each page with a series of modular PHP functions that mirror the structure of an XHTML document. One of which of course creates the head element. All pages use the root.css stylesheet. If I need to pull in more, I simply pass an array of them to the head function: head(array(&#8216;forms&#8217;,&#8217;tables&#8217;));&#8212;same thing with extra Javascript libraries (although I don&#8217;t use them very much, being a server-side kinda guy).<br />

Why you little sneak! Actually, if I&#8217;m right and you got the icon from the one I created yesterday then you guys are the first to do this (that I&#8217;m aware of) and it makes me smile to know this. Personally, I use the favicons as a mnemonic tool for my listings in the DB. I can visualize what page I&#8217;m about to visit just before I click through to it. Minor eye candy too. Not sure if my visitors benefit from it or not. If a site I list doesn&#8217;t have one, then I create it. If the owner likes it and uses it, well, that&#8217;s great!</div>

It all depends on what styles are you reusing, which styles I can load already, which browsers I target (important !!). <br />
<br />
also when it is cut up in different files, it loads chunk by chunk, although not all chunks are equal loads</div>

<div class="comment-text">Yeah, absolutely. How you break up your stylesheets completely depends on what makes sense to you and the project you&#8217;re working on. I go for slightly larger chunks because that&#8217;s how my head works best but if you can keep track of more files then by all means do!<br />
<br />
For example, I like to keep my hacks along with the rules they&#8217;re over-riding so that I don&#8217;t lose track of them, but I also appreciate the advantages of keeping them in separate stylesheets. (I stopped doing that after spending ages trying to debug a sheet only to find that the rule I was grappling with was being reset elsewhere and I didn&#8217;t realise.)</div>

<div class="comment-text">Several issues as conclusion from the comments :<br />
1. 5 connections is bad for clients<br />
2. php is a solution that can minimize 5 connections<br />
3. php wont cache right (why?)<br />
<br />
Now an integration of these comments brings out this idea :<br />
<br />
A php script that will import all 5 stylesheets&#8212;while he&#8217;s importing, also do some basic processing of the styles to combine similar definitions.<br />
<br />
Example :<br />
<br />
1. these tags are in different files :<br />
h1 { font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 10em }<br />
h1 { margin-left: 3em; }<br />
h1 { color: blue; background-color: cyan; }<br />
<br />
2. the php script combines it all into one tag like so :<br />
h1 { font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 10em; margin-left: 3em; color: blue; background-color: cyan; }<br />
<br />
3. the php script sets its time correctly . . . to the last updated css file (if you update color.css last, then that is the time php script should send out)<br />
<br />
This way what will happen is :<br />
1. proper caching will work (right times reported)<br />
2. multiple (5) connections is not an issue<br />
3. css taking too much &#8220;space&#8221;/&#8221;bandwidth&#8221; is not an issue<br />
4. extra connections for style wont happen<br />
5. modular css is still managable!<br />
6. php script is a real easy one, and might be fast (enough) as well&#8230;<br />
<br />
is there anything that I am missing?<br />
anything anyone wants to suggest extra?</div>

<div class="comment-text">Hmmmm, that sounds interesting. You&#8217;ll have to make sure that the script combines the rules in the order they are imported (as in your example). It would probably be worth adding whitespace stripping to the final files as well for a bit of added compression.<br />
<br />
The only issue for me is that I use combinations of stylesheets across pages within a site. By that I mean that the home page might have:<br />
@import url(&#8220;typo.css&#8221;);<br />
@import url(&#8220;layout.css&#8221;);<br />
@import url(&#8220;home-layout.css&#8221;);<br />
@import url(&#8220;horizontal-nav.css&#8221;);<br />
@import url(&#8220;skin.css&#8221;);<br />
<br />
While a cotent page might take:<br />
@import url(&#8220;typo.css&#8221;);<br />
@import url(&#8220;forms.css&#8221;);<br />
@import url(&#8220;layout.css&#8221;);<br />
@import url(&#8220;horizontal-nav.css&#8221;);<br />
@import url(&#8220;skin.css&#8221;);<br />
<br />
The idea is to use browser caching to my advantage &#8211; only feeding new sheets as they are required. Your technique wouldn&#8217;t work for all the sites I work on but it would definitely be very useful for some&#8230; <br />
<br />
Good idea!</div>

<div class="comment-text">If you&#8217;re going to go to that length, you might as go one step further; parse the CSS, combine it into a single logical file and cache it.<br />
<br />
As an example:<br />
1) First hit to the site, do I have a valid cached copy?<br />
2) If no &#8211; read, parse, optimise, save final product<br />
3) If yes &#8211; send the cached copy<br />
<br />
Using that sort of a method, you wouldn&#8217;t have to read/parse/optimise the files each hit on the site.<br />

<div class="comment-text">Hmm, are we now talkin to optimize the CSS on the fly or on change?<br />
Alistair: If you combine all files for each page into one file you would loose caching of parts, e.g. the navigation.<br />
Evgeny : optimizing the CSS files on the fly or on export and combining multiple blocks into one could bring up problems with selectors and specifity. However, you might wanna check out <a href="http://csstidy.sourceforge.net/">CSSTidy</a> to do what you want to.</div>

I was actually looking for another coding solution to a problem I had when I found this site. My website is skinned, and I would want a tagboard that uses the css of the specific skin (not the regular importing css code that imports from a specified location). I was looking for a code that just imports the stylesheet of the specific skin. I&#8217;ll try looking around this site if you have such a code, but in any case, thanks! :)</div>
