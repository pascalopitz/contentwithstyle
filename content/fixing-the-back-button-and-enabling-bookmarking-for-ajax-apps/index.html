<div class="article">
    <h2>The problem</h2>
<p>Everyone's favourite AJAX technology app is Google Maps. Google have done a stunning job... But when I came to try to bookmark a page I had to hunt around for 'link to this page' over on the right hand side. Why have they broken such a basic function of the web? I use bookmarks A LOT and the extra effort bothered me. I got over it though, and life went on. </p>

<p>Then I came to flick through the drop down on Kottke.org (now removed) and I kept hitting the back button on my mouse by accident, taking me off the site. Really irritating. The most fundamental online behaviour - click then back, is broken.</p>

<p>I've not picked on these sites for any particular reason. They both happen to be great sites that I visit regularly enough to notice these flaws, which will be common to many AJAX-based applications.</p>

<p>After a chat with <a href="http://www.adactio.com">Jeremy Keith</a>, <a href="http://www.clagnut.com">Rich Rutter</a> and <a href="http://www.andybudd.com">Andy Budd</a> about exactly this problem I decided to take a shot at fixing it.</p>

<p>Read on for the explanation or <a href="http://donotremove.co.uk/extra/ajax-nav/index.html">go straight to the demo</a> to see it in action.</p>

<h2>Standing on the shoulders of giants</h2>
<p>I'm not the first person to tackle this type of problem. I've drawn inspiration and know-how from several places to get this up and running:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>The original bookmark/back button fix, as used by Flash developers for a little while now:</dt>
    <dd><a href="http://www.robertpenner.com/experiments/backbutton/backbutton.html">www.robertpenner.com/experiments/backbutton/flashpage.html</a></dd>

    <dt>I've not actually looked at how they implemented their solution but this is where I got the idea for replacing Robert Penner's frames with iframes:</dt>
    <dd><a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/intro_to_dojo_io.html#so-about-that-thorny-back-button">dojotoolkit.org/intro_to_dojo_io.html#so-about-that-thorny-back-button</a></dd>

    <dt>Rich Rutter's use of the hash for bookmarking:</dt>
    <dd><a href="http://www.clagnut.com/sandbox/slideshow.html#5">www.clagnut.com/sandbox/slideshow.html#5</a></dd>

    <dt>For this little experiment I've used Harry Fuecks' <a href="http://jpspan.sourceforge.net/wiki/doku.php">JPSpan</a> </dt>
    <dd>It's a fantastic framework that makes the methods you define in your server-side PHP classes available to your Javascript via XmlHttpRequest. It's the simplest way I've come across to get started with AJAX. I had the guts of my demo up and running in about 10 minutes!</dd>

    <dt>I'm using Algorithm's Timer object:</dt>
    <dd><a href="http://www.codingforums.com/archive/index.php/t-10531.html">www.codingforums.com/archive/index.php/t-10531.html</a></dd>

    <dt>And Scott Andrew's cross-browser event handler:</dt>
    <dd><a href="http://www.scottandrew.com/weblog/articles/cbs-events">www.scottandrew.com/weblog/articles/cbs-events</a></dd>
</dl>

<h2>Setting things up</h2>
<p>I created a PageLocator object to act as an interface to both real querystrings and my hash pseudo-querystrings. It's nothing complicated but it allows me to access both using the same methods...</p>

<pre>
function PageLocator(propertyToUse, dividingCharacter) {
    this.propertyToUse = propertyToUse;
    this.defaultQS = 1;
    this.dividingCharacter = dividingCharacter;
}
PageLocator.prototype.getLocation = function() {
    return eval(this.propertyToUse);
}
PageLocator.prototype.getHash = function() {
    var url = this.getLocation();
    if(url.indexOf(this.dividingCharacter) &gt; -1) {
        var url_elements = url.split(this.dividingCharacter);
        return url_elements[url_elements.length-1];
    } else {
        return this.defaultQS;
    }
}
PageLocator.prototype.getHref = function() {
    var url = this.getLocation();
    var url_elements = url.split(this.dividingCharacter);
    return url_elements[0];
}
PageLocator.prototype.makeNewLocation = function(new_qs) {
    return this.getHref() + this.dividingCharacter + new_qs;
}
</pre>

<p>I also have a setContent function that simply takes whatever you pass it and inserts it into the content container div on the page. I'm using the innerHtml property because it's really not the point of this demo. If I was doing it properly I'd probably go for something a little cleverer.</p>

<pre>
function setContent(new_content) {
    if(!document.getElementById || !document.getElementsByTagName) return;
    var container = document.getElementById("content");
    container.innerHTML = new_content;
}
</pre>

<p>In the spirit of 'proper' scripting my demo will work with javascript turned off. The links on the page point  to content.php, which loads the same content as the AJAX app, but server side.</p>

<h2>It's all too easy</h2>
<p>So, I'm trying to store the session state in the address bar to allow bookmarking. What can be changed in the URL that won't trigger a page reload? The hash portion. So what I need to do is add my AJAX application's parameters after a #. </p>

<p>There is an additional benefit to this approach: When you click on page anchors, these points are added to the browser's history object so that when you press the back button you're taken back to these points within the same page. That's important because items are being added to the history without leaving the current page. </p>

<p>To make use of this behaviour I wrote written a simple DOM script to change the links on my page into # anchors, with the # portion containing the argument that would have been passed to content.php (the server-side equivalent of this app). This effectively maps the real querystring to a hash pseudo querystring.</p>

<p>Now when the links are clicked, the address bar is changed but the page itself doesn't change. To sync the page content with the URL I've set a Javascript timer to poll the window.location.href property on a regular basis and use any changes to trigger an AJAX content-load action. This effectively de-couples the default browser functionality, so instead of changing the page when a link is pressed, this now happens whenever something in the address bar changes. This means that if we change the URL manually or, importantly, with a bookmark, the page's content is automatically changed to reflect the new url.</p>

<p>To my surprise, it was very simple to get this all set up and working in Firefox. I was even more surprised to see that it worked reasonably well in IE6 as well. Reasonably, but not completely. For some reason, IE wasn't adding my anchors to the history so when I hit back, I was taken off my page and the AJAX app reset its state. </p>

<pre>
function AjaxUrlFixer() {
    this.fixLinks();

    this.locator = new PageLocator("window.location.href", "#");
    this.timer = new Timer(this);
    this.checkWhetherChanged(0);
}
AjaxUrlFixer.prototype.fixLinks = function () {
    var links = document.getElementsByTagName("A");
    for(var i=0; i&lt;links.length; i++) {
        var href = links[i].getAttribute("href");
        var hash = href.substr(href.indexOf("hash=")+5);
        links[i].setAttribute("href","#"+hash);
    }
}
AjaxUrlFixer.prototype.checkWhetherChanged = function(location){
    if(this.locator.getHash() != location) {
        doGetPage(this.locator.getHash());
    }
    this.timer.setTimeout("checkWhetherChanged", 200, this.locator.getHash());
}
</pre>

<h2>Now you're just being difficult</h2>
<p>So, IE won't add my modified anchors to the history object. There is a fix that's been in use by Flash developers for a little while that uses frames to trick the browser into thinking that it's loading new pages, and use that to trap and mimic the back button action within the Flash apps. See <a href="http://www.holler.co.uk">www.holler.co.uk</a> for an example of this in action.</p>

<p>After reading through the Flash back button fix and remembering Dojo Toolkit's reference to their own back button fix I decided to give iframes a shot. The catch is that the iframe has to be present on the page before the DOM tree is complete so it has to be document.written out inline. It's not the cleanest solution because it means that I need to have a script block in the BODY, which I like to avoid, but as far as I know there's no way around that.</p>

<p>With the iframe in, the mechanism is roughly the same... </p>

<p>Instead of changing the links on the page to # anchors, they are modified to change the src attribute of the iframe, loading a page called mock-page.php with a querystring that contains the same argument as the hash did before. A timer polls the iframe for it's location and if it detects a change then a content load is triggered in the AJAX app, same as before. </p>

<p>This is complicated by the fact that the iframe's src property doesn't change when the back button is pressed. To get around this I've written a little function to sit within mock-page.php and report it's location when asked.</p>

<pre>
function getLocation() {
    return '&lt;?php print "http://" . $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] . $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] . "?" . $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] ?&gt;';
}
</pre>

<p>When a change in mock-page.php's url is detected an AJAX content load is triggered and the parameters from it's querystring are duplicated into the url, to make sure that bookmarking will still work. It's sounds a bit convoluted but the code is quite straight forward. Except for one thing... IE wouldn't let me access the window.location immediately. I have no idea why... As a simple workaround, I've added a tiny 100ms delay to the firing of the script, which seems to sort it out.</p>

<pre>
function AjaxIframesFixer(iframeid) {
    this.iframeid = iframeid;
    if (document.getElementById('ajaxnav')) {
        this.fixLinks();

        this.locator = new PageLocator("document.frames['"+this.iframeid+"'].getLocation()", "?hash=");
        this.windowlocator = new PageLocator("window.location.href", "#");
        this.timer = new Timer(this);

        this.delayInit(); // required or IE doesn't fire
    }
}
AjaxIframesFixer.prototype.fixLinks = function (iframeid) {
    var links = document.getElementsByTagName("A");
    for(var i=0; i&lt;links.length; i++) {
        var href = links[i].getAttribute("href");
        var hash = href.substr(href.indexOf("hash=")+5);
        links[i].setAttribute("href", "Javascript:document.getElementById('"+this.iframeid+"').setAttribute('src', 'mock-page.php?hash="+hash+"');");
    }
}
AjaxIframesFixer.prototype.delayInit = function(){
    this.timer.setTimeout("checkBookmark", 100, "");
}
AjaxIframesFixer.prototype.checkBookmark = function(){
    window.location = this.windowlocator.makeNewLocation(this.locator.getHash());
    this.checkWhetherChanged(0);
}
AjaxIframesFixer.prototype.checkWhetherChanged = function(location){
    if(this.locator.getHash() != location) {
        doGetPage(this.locator.getHash());
        window.location = this.windowlocator.makeNewLocation(this.locator.getHash());
    }
    this.timer.setTimeout("checkWhetherChanged", 200, this.locator.getHash());
}
</pre>

<h2>It's not what you said it's how you said it</h2>
<p>I hate branching scripts but I couldn't find a method that would work across all browsers. To make things as easy as possible I've made the fixes objects so they can be plugged or removed as easily as possible.</p>

<pre>
function FixBackAndBookmarking() {
    if(!document.getElementById || !document.getElementsByTagName) return;
    if(document.iframesfix) {
        fix = new AjaxIframesFixer('ajaxnav');
    } else {
        fix = new AjaxUrlFixer();
    }
}
</pre>

<h2>Moving on</h2>

<p>What I've produced here is a simple illustration of a method for storing the browser state in the URL bar, to allow bookmarking, replaced the default browser linking mechanism to use that url-stored state and mimic traditional web behaviour. For a real world application the querystring used is likely to be far more complicated... I've separated out my code into distinct objects to try and make customisation easier.</p>

<p>To see it in action, I have put up <a href="http://donotremove.co.uk/extra/ajax-nav/index.html">a demo page with everything hooked together</a>.</p>

<p>This method could be applied to Flash as well. As far as I know most people are still using the full frames method documented by Robert Penner. Using some Javascript we can do away with that extra complexity to make going back and bookmarking a plug-and-play addition.</p>

<h2>Reservations</h2>
<p>As I was writing this it occurred to me that what I've been doing here is remarkably like the old Frames hacks from back in the day. Should we be trying so hard to duplicate traditional browser behaviour? If it's important enough to put in the effort to duplicate it then should we really be breaking it in the first place? It's a question that can only be answered on a project-by-project basis but it seems important enough to be worth asking...</p>

<div class="comment-text">Fascinating article, Mike. Here&#8217;s a thought: if you allow the href=&#8221;#thing&#8221; to act as a link to a real anchor on the page (so use return true instead of return false) as well as a trigger for the scripting, then the latest version JAWS has a chance of working with your AJAX too.<br />
<br />
So when you make a change to an area of the page you can link to that area and help guide (some) screen readers (indeed all modern browsers) to the new content.</div>

<div class="comment-text">It isn&#8217;t exactly Ajax, but I&#8217;ve been considering doing this for S5 as well.  You can already use fragment identifiers to go straight to a slide, but the address bar doesn&#8217;t change when you move through the slide show.  It&#8217;s been an occasional request, and if I decide to do it, I&#8217;ll definitely look at your code to see how it should be done.  Thanks!</div>

<br />
I reckon this could have uses outside of AJAX but that&#8217;s just what I happened to be talking about when I came up with the idea, and it stuck. I&#8217;d love to see people put this concept to use elsewhere! Flash seemed like the obvious one, since it&#8217;s asynchronous too, but your S5 app requires the decoupling of the default browser machinery as well, so this might be of some use.</div>

Thanks, I was in the process of researching all this stuff for my ajax apps.  Prototype (Ajax framework built into RoR) needs this.  I&#8217;ve been working on making prototype fail (ie regular links unless ajax is available) and will think of how to add this as well.</div>

<div class="comment-text">Nice stuff. It looks like the code snippets here are wrong though&#8230; take the following code:<br />
<br />
    for(var i=0; i<br />
        var href = links[i].getAttribute(&#8220;href&#8221;);<br />
<br />
There&#8217;s something missing there ;-)<br />
<br />
Also, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good idea to pass on strings of JavaScript code to PageLocator. You&#8217;d rather write a little wrapper function to execute that code than starting up the JS parser by using `eval`.<br />
<br />
And Jonathan, I don&#8217;t think the app itself will work without JavaScript, so that isn&#8217;t much of a problem.</div>

<div class="comment-text">Damn, I was just working on a demonstration javascript which does exactly that a few days ago to put on my website, but it isn&#8217;t finished yet. So you beat me to it, and that sucks!<br />
<br />
Anyways, a few comments:<br />
 &#8211; It would be easier to use window.location.hash instead of window.location.href;<br />
 &#8211; Instead of loading actual pages with the iframe, you can use iframe.contentWindow.document.open, write and close to achieve the same effect;<br />
 &#8211; And if you use that instead, you can also let it send an event to the script element on load using onload=&#8221;&#8221; or  so you don&#8217;t need the 100ms timeout.<br />
<br />
I don&#8217;t really have time to look into it further now.<br />

<div class="comment-text">First, for comment 7 (Jonathan) it breaks without js? Wasn&#8217;t AJAX all about js?<br />
(you&#8217;re welcome Mike :)<br />
<br />
The technique is cool , i have been looking into it and still might try my own solution for it someday, still digging into js stuff.<br />
The one thing i didn&#8217;t like was the part that the # makes the page jump to the top again (at least at my first view on FF/Linux). Might be something to look into.<br />

<div class="comment-text">I really like the way you have set up this article. How clear can you get writing up where it&#8217;s tested and where it works? By the way, I wouldn&#8217;t mind (and I&#8217;m sure Mike doesn&#8217;t either) feedback and improvements from other configurations than the tested ones. Thinking about the Opera version which supports XmlHttpRequest, is that out properly? I&#8217;ve lost track with Opera, which is a shame. Or any Linux variations. And please no weird hacked or specialized versions. The ones your mum / your client would use is fine. And a cake. And presents. I also wonder what the limitations on Safari are. <br />
I think what Jonathan means, is that if you turn JS off, there is no css loaded with the content when you click on the links. But I think that&#8217;s due to the demo being a demo, or am I wrong?</div>

<br />
I don&#8217;t think eval used on the client side is a big issue, unlike the server side when input variables are evaluated. So I don&#8217;t agree with the statement that eval is a lame solution.
<br />
What's the worst thing that could happen? Since anyone can read the source and all the data is already passed to the browser it would be possible to execute anything through <code>javascript:doWhatIWant(with.myObject)</code> anyway ...
<br />

If you want to make the thing &#8220;secure&#8221; than check the propertyToUse against a list of allowed properties.

<br />
<br />

When we move to PHP code that&#8217;s a different story. In general you should always make sure that gets fed into a string which will be parsed by eval CANNOT contain anything malicious.<br />

     this.locator = new PageLocator(function(){return window.location.href}, &#8221;#&#8221;);<br />

<div class="comment-text">Eval has some necessary uses, though it&#8217;s slow because the parser has to go over each eval line twice: once to evaluate the statement, and once to execute it. Not a huge problem for small scripts, but not the most elegant solution either. I use eval sometimes to escape function literals (var foo = function(){/* bar */};) because they cause syntax errors in some older (now ancient) browsers. <br />
<br />
However, in your case, if you just need to evaluate a string as a variable name, why not use a string index of an associative array?<br />

if(this.validProperties[propertyToUse]){<br />

Thanks also to James. I&#8217;ve always tried to avoid eval but it&#8217;s been so long that I&#8217;d actually forgotten why. The reason I used it here is because I couldn&#8217;t think of a way to make the wrapper flexible enough to monitor a variety of properties.

And yes, eval is evil. Any time you see it you should ask yourself why? The only valid reason to use it is to allow a user to enter code that you want to evaluate. In your case it seems what you want to pass as an argument is the location object (or as previously suggested a function returning the object in question).</div>

<br />
in the links pointing to content.php you can add a parameter to the url  hash=n&#38;nojs=true, in php if you see this parameter you also include the header and footer of the page, this way people who have js disabled will be loading content.php the old way AND getting the same page (with the black strips on top and bottom) ,  for people with JS enabled the href is rewritten using javascript (removing the nojs=true and using the # hack) and they will use ajax just like they are doing now!<br />

<div class="comment-text">I think I see what you mean Pat. As it is, if you turn off your JS, go to the demo and click the links they will still bring back your content, via a separate page that uses the same content-generating class server side but without any styling.

<div class="comment-text">Mr. Schopman, I think you didn&#8217;t propperly take time understand the scope of this article. Mike is not coding an AJAX application here, but pointing out a possible solution for a common problem occurring with AJAX applications.<br />
This has nothing to do with beeing cool but is an approach for all those who do use AJAX but find that the back button isn&#8217;t just a useless thing in the top corner of the browser.<br />
<br />
Whether people that are actually building AJAX applications and maybe incorporating this solution into their AJAX application are ignorant this might be your point of view, but we don&#8217;t necessarily agree with you at that point.<br />
<br />
However, the only useful points you really made are<br />
<br />
a) You should use things because they make sense<br />
b) You might not be able to use an iframe in your application, therefore the solution mike suggested could not be for you<br />

Thanks for writing fix for back button problem with AJAX.<br />

Well, i am trying to fix this problem by utilising your code but I am not using JPSPAN function for AJAX. I am simply using XMLHTTP object and its function to make request to my server side php and getting html data ( i don&#8217;t need xml data).<br />
<br />
I am not sure whether your fix will work for all the AJAX code. But i will appreciate if you change it to be compatible and generic for all AJAX. As of now, with your scripts I am totally confused to use what and where? Can you please write a small paragraph on how to plug this into any AJAX code. I am not JS expert nor I am AJAX expert.<br />

And I do have real time monitoring system which uses ajax and in my page there are four frames which are requesting to server and loading data in real time.<br />

<div class="comment-text">Hi Mike<br />
<br />
The code fix is good and would do the job for simple pages. The way I have written my ajax application is that it has a mvc pattern on the browser tier and performs view rendering on the client.<br />
this should have been &#8221; backable &#8221; using ur style but the issue we face is with handling multiple views.. <br />
a user interaction triggers view updates in multiple views on the page. so a back button click or a bookmark operation would involve remembering the state of all the views.<br />
any ideas on such a scenario..</div>

<div class="comment-text">hi,<br />
<br />
Thanks for replying and putting commented files on your site. Greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
It is still customized to your page, (it has all the elements which you have created in your html) and it is  tailored like that. I am not JS expert, but as far as I could make out, following javascript  functions must be related to page history :<br />
<br />
1) chkURL() &gt; This function you must be calling on load. Am i right ? This is so that it can check the URL and store it.<br />
<br />
2) getPageN() > Get this page number from the history?<br />
<br />
3) getPageName() &gt; This is for your contact page thing?<br />
<br />
4) getPage() > requesting this page and displaying it in the browser?<br />
<br />
Well, the major problem which i see in using this is  I am using 4 frames. There is no event based display of the pages, I am refreshing screen if something is happening at the back end and displaying it to the client. For this I have 4 frames in the page, which has different data and I am updating this data. <br />
<br />
Does your solution still fits into my architecture?<br />
<br />
Thanks once again for writing commented version of your code.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
just replace {}  with the the tag thingies<br />
<br />
are required for it to function in Internet Explorer and are only for history, so all the functions there are for history.<br />
<br />
I think what you&#8217;re doing is similar to how gmail auto-updates the user&#8217;s inbox. If you need people to navigate back in your app, this wil work. All you need is to have people navigate by page.htm#wheretogo and have the chkURL() fire a function to deal with the wheretogo when it changes.<br />

<div class="comment-text">Jim, if you look up the comments a bit you&#8217;ll see a link from a chap calling himself &#8216;Nobody&#8217; to an implementation he&#8217;s come up with.

<br />
From what I can gather the good folk behind PHP have decided to tighten up their pass-by-reference handling and creating new objects. I don&#8217;t know the ins and outs of it to be honest. I had several days of listening to Marcus complain about the changes he was having to make to <a href="http://www.simpletest.org">SimpleTest</a> but that&#8217;s about my lot! There&#8217;s a decent explanation on SitePoint though: <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2005/07/30/php-44-minor-gotcha/">PHP 4.4 Minor Gotcha</a>. Hope that helps&#8230;</div>

How you hook up your Ajax to your back-end technology isn&#8217;t the point of this article &#8211; that&#8217;s why I used an out-of-the-box solution like JPSpan to deal with that aspect for me. Here I am only concerned with how you trick the browsers into adding to their history and proposing a way to get bookmarking working. This method actually isn&#8217;t limited to Ajax either &#8211; Matthias has got it working for Flash and it would work fine with Eric&#8217;s S5 too.<br />
<br />
doGetPage is the function that gets content from the server side. If you were doing this for yourself that is the function that you would have to change. pageholder is a PHP class on the sever side whose method ashtml returns a string of HTML. It&#8217;s not documented in the article because, as I said before, the transfer method is irrelevant. It&#8217;s all in the zip file though if you want to take a proper look for yourself&#8230;<br />
<br />
I&#8217;ve not updated the script for the same reason I&#8217;ve not written any new articles recently: time! I&#8217;ve just got too much work on to spend much more time on this, which is done completely for free. When I get time I&#8217;ll do some kind of redux but until then I would highly recommend checking out Nobody&#8217;s comments above &#8211; he&#8217;s come up with another method for doing the same thing, based on this one, and Robert Nyman&#8217;s <a href="http://www.robertnyman.com/2006/02/08/ask-ajax-source-kit/">AJAX Source Kit</a>, which looks really good.</div>

<div class="comment-text">Hey guys!<br />
<br />
First of all, thanks a lot for a really useful article, Mike. It gave me exactly the help I was looking for. I&#8217;ve been implementing your methods in a new website I&#8217;m working on for Persnickety Tim&#8217;s Coffee, but I&#8217;ve got this freakish behaviour going on in IE version 6 on the PC, and I can&#8217;t for the life of me figure it out.<br />
<br />
You can see what I&#8217;m talking about at http://test.ptims.com (just open it with IE). The only AJAX-enabled buttons right now are the Buy Coffee links and the Gift Baskets link. Click around between those pages, maybe use the back button once and then click the buttons a couple more times&#8212;first of all, you&#8217;ll see that the window title changes, while the only thing Javascript is changing is the window.location property (I&#8217;ve also tried window.location.href and window.location.hash). Second and more importantly, IE goes to a blank page and the top left icon (above the File menu) changes as well.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;ve been scratching my head for a week on this one. If I comment out the line that changes window.location (or .hash or .href), things work great&#8212;the back button included. But once I try to change window.location, it freaks out. I&#8217;ve tried changing window.location after the iframe src change, before it, I&#8217;ve even had window.location change a couple seconds before changing the iframe src&#8212;the error keeps coming up.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;m on the verge of foregoing the bookmark functionality, but I thought I&#8217;d see if any of you great minds are up for a challenge. I&#8217;ll be grateful for any help. Thanks!</div>

<div class="comment-text">Hello Mike and thank you for your answer. I definately know what it&#8217;s like not to have time, and I guess in the end it comes down to my own ability to do tricks with javascript, whether I get it to work as I intend to or not.<br />
<br />
I think my basic problem was that I didn&#8217;t really see what type of data that function returned, and it didn&#8217;t say it was a transfer function. Thanks for the explaination.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;ll have a look at &#8220;Nobody&#8221;&#8217;s comments above, and I have already had a look at Robert&#8217;s Ajax implementation &#8211; it look really great, and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have a look at it when I get through the exams :p.</div>

this works great!<br />
I modified it a bit in order to make normal anchors work as well and it worked out perfect.<br />
<br />
I tried it in netscape 7.1 as well just for checking compatibility and unfourtunatley it does NOT work there&#8230;though netscape is mozilla based.  Very strange.<br />
<br />
Maybe u can work this out.<br />

<div class="comment-text">I am using Brad Neubergs solution for retaining the back-button functionality, and it works very well.<br />
<br />
There is, however, one thing I do not like (but seems to be IE&#8217;s standard behaviour): the selection box on the back- and forward buttons (for freely selecting any visited page instaed of going just back and forth) always show the full page URI (which is usally so long, it is meaningless, as you only see the server address), where I would only like to see the visited pages title.<br />
<br />
And to my great delight, your demo app does just that: it displays the entry &#8220;Dummy Page&#8221; there!<br />
<br />

As far as I understand this, together with at lot of good comments from others, such as &#8220;Nobody&#8221; , may solve my problem. It&#8217;s great that you people are willing to share good ideas with others!<br />
<br />
I may not use your script, but the idea itself was what I needed. <br />
<br />
My users, wich are puples and theachers in Norwegian shools, love the AJAX-solution but miss bookmarking and the buttons. Dealing with that kind of users we really need to take care of this issue. Your solution just gave me hope :)<br />
<br />
My only concern is that this idea triggered me and probably will keep me awake the rest of the night ;)<br />
<br />
Hopefully the browser vendors will give us some solutions, but that may take some time.<br />
<br />
Thank you for taking the time to write the script and the article!<br />

I guess the reason why you see long URL&#8217;s in IE&#8217;s selection box  is that you have ben browsing pages whitout a proper title. In my selction boxes I see readable titles when I have been visiting pages with titles&#8230;</div>

<div class="comment-text">I know I am a little late to this discussion. I have been following it but never commented on it.<br />
<br />
My approach so far has been to use a bootstrap page of some sort (pick your flavor of server side language)<br />
<br />
ALL requests are routed through the bootstrap page using your favorite rewrite engine. (mod rewrite in my case) The page then parses out the path in the address bar and stores the values.<br />
<br />
Each controller knows that if is invoked with params that are passed AFTER a # that the request is &#8220;ajaxy&#8221; and behaves as appropriate. If the url doesn&#8217;t have a hash the backend composes a page and returns it.<br />
<br />
The js on the front simply doesn&#8217;t fire if it isn&#8217;t fully supported. Once it fires it finds all link elements that allow ajax style updates of content (via class, id, rel, rev, hash tables of ajax listeners .. doesn&#8217;t matter ) and replaces their real url with the same exact string preceded by a #.<br />
<br />
Without ajax support the links are real url://domain.com/foo/bar style links. With ajax support they are url://domain/#foo/bar style links.<br />
<br />
It is all proof of concept code so far. But if I get it working more nicely I will of course share.<br />
<br />
Sorry if this is off topic. I started to ramble.</div>

<br />
It is simpler to use.  Assuming you have PHP setup, you can just pop it onto your webserver and see it work.<br />
<br />
It has a <strong>noframes fix</strong>, so that if someone chooses not to use frames, the site will still work, even if the frames don&#8217;t fix the back button.<br />
<br />
The example I wrote has <strong>code highlighting</strong> so it is easier to read as well.  The main advantage my example is you can just read the code and see how it all works.</div>

<div class="comment-text">The demo works fine in Firefox 1.0, but try this in Firefox 1.5 (PC or Mac):<br />
<br />
1) Open the demo<br />
2) Click on page 2<br />
3) Open any page outside of the demo (e.g. Google)<br />
4) Click the back button<br />
<br />
The hash should say #2 and page 2, but instead it&#8217;s page 1 and no hash. It actually goes back to the hash value (or lack thereof) when the page was first opened. If you try this test by going to page 3 directly first (with #3) in step 1, at step 4 it&#8217;ll be page 3 again.<br />
<br />
It appears to only be a &#8220;cosmetic&#8221; bug; the value in location.hash is wrong, but if you click reload or go back then forward again, the right page/hash shows up. My theory is that this is caused by the page being still in the session history / fastback cache (new with 1.5), but I haven&#8217;t turned it off to test it completely. (If after step 3 you visit more than 8 pages then go back to the demo in step 4, which should flush the demo out of the cache, the right page/hash appears).<br />
<br />
Has anyone seen the same behaviour before? Any workaround or information (even a bugilla report)?</div>

<div class="comment-text">Recently implemented a solution that was originally based on Brad Neuberg&#8217;s code but now has the advantages of having been cleaned up a bit and, best of all, no longer requires a separate iframe.  This means that IE will not hit the webserver with a request every time the back button is clicked.  The code can be found here:<br />
http://cvs.horde.org/dimp/js/src/dhtmlHistory.js<br />

Usage is as simple as (in an onload function):<br />
if (dhtmlHistory.initialize()) {<br />

<div class="comment-text">Did anyone notice that IE DOES in fact create a new history entry if the # part of the URL is changed to an anchor tag that actually exists?  One solution to the IE problem (as opposed to the hidden IFRAME) is to have a container div that you inject an anchor tag into just before changing location.hash.  Here&#8217;s an example:<br />
<br />
&lt;script><br />
  function handleClick() {<br />
    var newAnchor;<br />
    // Do some Ajax type thing that sets newAnchor.<br />
<br />
    $(&#8216;container&#8217;).innerHTML = &#8220;&#8221;;<br />
    location.hash = newAnchor;<br />

I noticed that too. I used it to my favour by setting the value of &#8220;document.documentElement.id&#8221; to whatever my URL fragment was going to be in the same same function as the one that changes window.location &#8211; that way there is no need to create any extra markup to handle this in IE. For example:<br />
<br />
function UpdateAddressBar(address) {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;document.documentElement.id = address;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;window.location.href = &#8221;#&#8221; + address<br />
}<br />
<br />
Is what I used to get around this issue, where &#8216;address&#8217; is the URL fragment identified in another part of my script.</div>

I&#8217;ve had a brief look at it, and it looks like a very nice and clean implementation, and well documented, too!<br />

From what I could see, the solution is mainly (only?) for Firefox and IE. I wonder if and when someone finds the time to do a nicely coded solution that contains the Safari solution as well.<br />
Then again, the one that I was told of, was based on a bug, so that might be fixed with the next release and &#8220;break&#8221; the back button&#8230;<br />

<div class="comment-text">Ok, I understand the usage but why??? If you are creating a TRUE &#8220;Internet application&#8221;, open the damn thing into a modal-style window with no nav buttons.  <br />
<br />
You are not enhancing the user&#8217;s experience by using AJAX instead of an IFRAME.  You are just creating more work for yourself. <br />
<br />
I use AJAX for internet applications.  Constructed correctly, an Internet Application does not need all of this unnecessary JavaScript and hidden frame garbage.  Everyone thinks that the BACK button is an AJAX hindrance; it is not.  A website that uses AJAX to load content into a DIV container is just plain foolish and a waste of time.  Don&#8217;t use AJAX because it is &#8220;cool and nifty&#8221;, use it only when it is the BETTER alternative.  <br />
<br />
Use AJAX to run API style calls and &#8220;change&#8221; the layout of the page dynamically, not import HTML.<br />

I am using a browser with a built in back button, it&#8217;s free and pretty decent. The name is Firefox, Google it. <br />
<br />
Seriously, the back button doesn&#8217;t need fixing, it&#8217;s not broken. The websites you mention need to be fixed. Each website that decides to implement &#8216;custom&#8217; navigation is so arrogant in presuming that users will not miss the back button behavior that they have to provide that themselves. Otherwise, their funky navigation is just broken.<br />
<br />
To the websites that decide to break the back button: Try a usability test, almost all users know and use the back button, it&#8217;s big and it&#8217;s the first one on the row. Where do you go off breaking such a fundamental part of the User Experience?<br />

Isn't it easier though to simple have the loaded iframe execute a script to update it's parent hash? Then you only have to poll the hash, which you're doing in <strong>normal</strong> (non-microsoft) browsers anyway.

You still have to make sure you don't do the same in IE and other browsers but it saves some code.

So your iframe calls this script from the body (or head for that matter). Assuming you use #var=val#var2=val2 syntax for the hash.
<code>
if (parent)
{
  var query			 = window.location.search;
  var hash			 = query.replace(/[?&amp;;]/gi, "#");
  parent.location.hash		 = hash;
}
</code>

Then you only have to plug the iframe in IE and the rest works the same as always. No need for polling the iframes location or a function in the iframe.
