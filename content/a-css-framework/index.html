<h1>A CSS Framework</h1>

<div class="info clearfix">
    <p class="credit">by Mike Stenhouse on May 22 2005, 16:20</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
    <p>In my <a href="/Articles/12/modular-css/">Modular CSS</a> article I documented the possibility of breaking down stylesheets into components that could be reused across projects. All well and good. The next logical step is to extend this to become a CSS framework, allowing rapid development of sites with pre-written and tested components. All that's really required to produce this is a set of naming conventions and a flexible base template... </p>

<h2>Who is this for?</h2>
<p>If you've been creating sites with CSS for a while you may be getting frustrated with having to recreate and retest basic layouts on a regular basis. In this article I'm trying to illustrate a simple way of skipping the tedious startup on your average project, letting you get to the interesting stuff as quickly and efficiently as possible. I've not attempted to explain the layouts included here so it may not be suitable if you're a CSS beginner. Sorry about that... Feel free to dissect them yourself if you're interested; I've kept them as simple as possible.</p>

<h2>How many layouts are there? </h2>
<p>Well, loads but the majority of them fall into rough groups. Any framework must account for the most common layouts, otherwise it'll never get used. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Vertical navigation with one content column</li>
    <li>Vertical navigation with two columns of content</li>
    
    <li>Horizontal navigation with one content column</li>
    <li>Horizontal navigation with 2 columns of content</li>
    <li>Horizontal navigation with local navigation and one column of content</li>
    <li>Horizontal navigation with local navigation and 2 columns of content</li>
</ul>

<p>These 6 cover most of the blogs out there and most of the corporate sites as well. How can we structure a document so that it'll be useful in all 6 of these scenarios?</p>

<h2>What are the common elements?</h2>
<p>Malarkey had a shot at pinning down <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/whats_in_a_name_pt2.html">websites' common elements and giving them names</a> a while back but I want something a little more general so that the building blocks can be retasked without slipping their labelling.</p>
<p>So... what are the common building blocks in the above 6 layouts?</p>

<ul>
    <li>Header</li>
    <li>Footer</li>
    
    <li>Main content</li>
    <li>Sub content</li>
    
    <li>Main nav</li>
    <li>Local nav</li>
</ul>

<p>These elements are used mix and match across most sites you visit so these are the constituent elements that any framework will have to cater for. No designs will use all of them but most will use header, footer, main content and main nav with optional sub content and sub nav.</p>

<h2>The ideal structure</h2>
<p>For me the most important single aspect of accessibility is the source code order: if it makes sense you're well on your way to building an accessible site. </p>
<p>You can't spent much time on the accessibility mailing lists or forums without someone being told that they should structure their HTML so that the content preceeds the navigation. This stops screenreader users from having to sit through the site's navigation every time they travel to a new page. You can get around this with skip links but that's an extra link to follow...</p>
<p>So, in an ideal world, how would we structure our websites?</p>
<ol>
    <li>Header</li>
    <li>Main content</li>
    <li>Sub content</li>
    <li>Local nav</li>
    <li>Main nav</li>
    <li>Footer</li>
</ol>
<p>This source order follows the exact structure people are expected to want: once they have read/listened to the content of your page they are most likely to want to navigate within the current section or to related pages. After they have worked their way through those they'll probably want another section of your site so the main navigation follows.</p>

<h2>The page structure</h2>

<p>This page structure above looks something like this when turned into (X)HTML:</p>

<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" 
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
    	&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;div id="page"&gt;
        
            &lt;div id="header" class="clearfix"&gt;
                &lt;hr /&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- end header --&gt;
            
            &lt;div id="content" class="clearfix"&gt;
                &lt;div id="main"&gt;
                    &lt;hr /&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                
                &lt;div id="sub"&gt;
                    &lt;hr /&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                
                &lt;div id="local"&gt;
                    &lt;hr /&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                
                &lt;div id="nav"&gt;
                    &lt;hr /&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                
            &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- end content --&gt;
            
            &lt;div id="footer" class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- end footer --&gt;
            
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- end page --&gt;
        
        &lt;div id="extra1"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div id="extra2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<h2>The magic of CSS</h2>
<p>We're going to need some farily advanced CSS tricks to turn this source order into useful layouts. They all have to be flexible, to account for text resizing, which with the footer rules out absolute positioning...</p>
<p>The eureka moment for me was when <a href="http://www.1976design.com/blog/archive/2004/11/21/solving-css-problems-mozilla-europe/">Dunstan published his absolutely positioned menu technique</a> as part of his Mozilla Europe work. Suddenly it became possible, using an incredibly sneaky trick, to pull the nav bar from the bottom of the source and use it horizontally in the header and still allow for text resizing. Now that's genius. </p>

<p>Then you've got the negative margin tricks for moving floats around. I first came across these when <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2004/01/23/friday_chall/">Ryan Brill posted about them on Mezzoblue</a>... Dead handy.</p>

<p>If we're going to use floated layouts we're going to need some way of clearing the contents. I could put clearing divs into each of my elements but there is the black magic <a href="http://positioniseverything.net/easyclearing.html">clearfix method by Tony Aslett</a> that will do this for me, keeping the source clean.</p>

<p>A few other things that might come in handy:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Body ids to switch styles</li>
    <li><a href="http://positioniseverything.net/explorer/floatIndent.html">Display: inline to cure IE's double float bug</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>See where I'm going with this?</h2>
<p>We have a single, flexible source document that will take a variety of content and a load of CSS techniques to manipulate them... To make this framework useful I have to be able to get my single source document to display as any of the common layouts listed above. Once that's done I'll be able to drop any content into the HTML framework, plug in the appropriate layout stylesheet for the design, tweak it and the job will be done. No more rewriting XHTML and CSS for every project; every time I start I will begin work with a solid foundation that I can tweak to fit the specifics of the job. Startup time will be next to nothing.</p>

<h2>Back to our five main layouts</h2>
<p>Okay, so the source code is fixed. What we want is to be able to plug in tried and tested layout stylesheets for reuse on future projects. I'm going to stick with fixed width layouts for this because they're simpler but using negative margins we could get these fluid with a bit of extra work.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="/resources/css-framework/1.1/?css=layout-navleft-1col.css&amp;demo=true">Vertical navigation with one content column</a></li>
    <li><a href="/resources/css-framework/1.1/?css=layout-navleft-2col.css&amp;demo=true">Vertical navigation with two columns of content</a></li>
    
    <li><a href="/resources/css-framework/1.1/?css=layout-navtop-1col.css&amp;demo=true">Horizontal navigation with one content column</a></li>
    <li><a href="/resources/css-framework/1.1/?css=layout-navtop-subright.css&amp;demo=true">Horizontal navigation with 2 columns of content</a></li>
    
    <li><a href="/resources/css-framework/1.1/?css=layout-navtop-localleft.css&amp;demo=true">Horizontal navigation with local navigation and one column of content</a></li>
    <li><a href="/resources/css-framework/1.1/?css=layout-navtop-3col.css&amp;demo=true">Horizontal navigation with local navigation and 2 columns of content</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Achieved: Level 2!</h2>
<p>That's it - all the common layouts done with pluggable stylesheets and ready to go. They're set up in a kind of Zen Allotment for you to <a href="/resources/css-framework/1.1/">have a flick through</a>...</p>
<p>If you want to have a play with these yourself, <a href="/resources/css-framework/1.1/css-framework.zip">all the source files</a> are packaged up in quick-grow zip file.</p>

<p><strong>30/11/2007 UPDATE:</strong> I've uploaded a slightly updated version of the framework. Very little has changed but a few people have voiced concerns over the lack of a formal license. Taking advice from <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com">Paul Jones</a> (thanks!) I've added the new BSD terms, which are about as open as they come. I'm happy for people to use the framework for whatever they want. If you do, please drop me a line - I'd love to see what you come up with!</p>

<div class="comment-text">I&#8217;m a bit late discovering this article, but nice going Mike. It&#8217;s in the same vein as something I tried to flesh out last year that I called the <a href="http://www.google.com.au/url?sa=U&#38;start=2&#38;q=http://www.opinios.com/archives/000073.php&#38;e=10141">CSS Sandwich</a>, although my focus was more on a best practice for managing CSS hacks. I wonder whether it might be worth expanding to include sidebars on the left <em>and</em> right hand side too. Combined with Malarkey&#8217;s semantic naming conventions, it would be great if every site that fell into these categories followed this structure. Can you imagine how easy that would be for maintaining someone else&#8217;s code!</div>

<div class="comment-text">Nice job :-)<br />
And quite usefull!!<br />
I just noticed that on &#8220;my&#8221; firefox (ubuntu) the navigation seems to be longer than header so the &#8220;Contact&#8221; link is on the 2nd line. Anyway, I already had to tackle that problem once. I just used a container for the horizontal navigation bar &#8211; with a fixed size (100% or in px I do not remember)  for that container. 

<br />
<br />

<code>
&lt;div id=&quot;navContainer&quot; style=&quot;width=xxx&quot;&gt;
<br />
&lt;div id=&quot;nav&quot;&gt;links&#8230;&lt;/div&gt;
<br />
&lt;/div&gt;

<div class="comment-text">Very nice! The modular approach is quite powerful.<br />
<br />
I don&#8217;t see any usage terms with these stylesheets. Is the intention for readers to be able to use these stylesheets directly to build from, or are you just sharing the techniques?<br />
<br />
(In the US, at least, you really can&#8217;t assume anything is available for any particular use unless it&#8217;s spelled out in front of you&#8230;)</div>

<div class="comment-text">Now all you need to do is automate the process with a scripting language and you have a tool to instanly build web sites. Like this;<br />
<br />
content -> html framework -> CSS applied -> Go live<br />
<br />
Users could interface with a form on the web, upload their content, the HTML framework would get populated, the CSS sheet applied, and their web host would display the finished file. Automatic! Then the designer would just create new cool stylesheets, or be put out of work.</div>

Jeremiah: That sort of thing would work really well for hosted blogging or the like, I reckon&#8230; Top idea!<br />

I&#8217;ve been using a similar workflow for my small freelance projects. For these I get given the design and I just pick the right layout sheet and start tweaking.<br />

This is something I&#8217;ve wanted to look into for a long time now. I&#8217;m one of those people who always manages to have to recreate basic layouts before continuing on to a more customized one, so this type of thinking should save me some work.<br />

As browser support becomes more frequent it&#8217;s easier to wean myself from tables-based formats.<br />

I&#8217;ve just spent a day exploring its features and learnt a lot. <br />
<br />
My only stumbling point is that I&#8217;m not sure how to recreate it locally without having the PHP server side scripting language. <br />

Is it possible to get the horizontal navigation and masthead to work without the PHP?<br />

Only one question: in <br />
<a href="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/resources/css-framework/index.php?css=layout-navtop-localleft.css">link to page</a> <br />
 I see that the Header is larger then the navigation menu. Isn&#8217;t it nicer if both are the same length? Or u did this way to have buttons on the navigation menu all the same length to look nicer?<br />
<br />
Sorry, maybe this is a newbie question<br />

The demo pages aren&#8217;t intended as &#8216;designs&#8217; &#8211; they&#8217;re just examples of the concept highlighted in the article. The point is that if you keep your HTML source consistent you can write and reuse modular layout sheets for the components of your websites. For example, if you write a horizontal nav bar then you can reuse it next time you need one, instead of starting from scratch. Hope that explains things a little better.</div>

Re: The pesky horizontal scrollbar&#8230;<br />
My screen res is 800&#215;600.<br />
<br />
To eliminate the horiz scroller,<br />
I actually have to grab a corner of the<br />
web browser and drag it right&#8230;<br />
<br />
With anything LESS than 780 pixels for the<br />
INSIDE window width, the horiz scroller appears.<br />
<br />
Here are some screenshots:<br />
<br />
1) Firefox &#8211; No horiz scrollbar &#8211; inside width &gt;= 780 pixels<br />
http://img131.echo.cx/my.php?image=firefoxnoscroll4hv.jpg<br />
<br />
2) Firefox &#8211; fugly horiz scrollbar &#8211; inside width &lt; 780 pixels<br />
http://img131.echo.cx/my.php?image=firefoxscroll2wo.jpg<br />
<br />
3) IE6 &#8211; No horiz scrollbar &#8211; inside width &gt;= 780 pixels<br />
http://img131.echo.cx/my.php?image=ie6noscroll3fw.jpg<br />
<br />
4) IE6 &#8211; fugly horiz scrollbar &#8211; inside width &lt; 780 pixels<br />

It&#8217;s working fine on your site, for example&#8230; I&#8217;m using Tony Aslett&#8217;s clearfix method to avoid structural clearing elements because I&#8217;m a bit of a semantic purist.

Incidentally, you will want to avoid using an id for your clearing elements since you&#8217;re likely to want to reuse them. Ids can only occur once on a page but classes can turn up as many times as you want.</div>

<br />
To sort your background problem I&#8217;d put the repeating faux-column gif on div#page instead of body. To get the shadow to show through you&#8217;ll probably need to put about 5px right padding on #page too. Then use one of the extra divs to put a bottom shadow under your page to tie it all together.<br />

<div class="comment-text">There may be some issues with the order of the markup on these &#8216;templates&#8217; in terms of practical usability. I completely agree that in an ideal world and with one eye on SEO, it makes perfect sense to place content as high up the markup as possible. <br />
<br />
However, when an organisation with vast experience in user testing looked at this type of markup order, they felt that, precisely because it not an order practiced on most sites, it could cause significant confusion amongst some users &#8211; especially screen reader users who may navigate a page not only in a very different manner to a sighted user but far faster.<br />
<br />
They suggested that a markup order that deliberately placed Main Navigation as the first major element in markup might well have the benefit of being &#8216;familiar&#8217; and thus increase overall usability.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;m not arguing against the markup order suggested above. I&#8217;m not convinced that there is a Right or Wrong here. I&#8217;m merely pointing out that what works in theory may not always translate well into practice &#8211; especially when trying to accomodate the learnt behaviours of site users.</div>

<div class="comment-text">And this is the joy of using floats with negative margins for vertical layouts &#8211; i.e. with the three column vertical layout, the markup for the left column (navigation) could be placed before the main content without needing to change a single line of CSS, keeping both camps happy :) <br />
<br />
Similarly, the right and left columns could also be switched in the markup. The only constraint being the right column cannot preceede the central column (using a negative left margin on the central column).<br />
<br />
Incidentally Mike, I have used a similar technique based on a negative right margin for quite a while. Provides the flexibility described above flipped the other way &#8211; constraints on left column :<br />
<br />

<br />
Generally I use this with either liquid or elastic layouts and works a charm on all modern browsers/platforms. Negative margins is a great technique with considerable flexibility and minimal constraints on markup that can help extend usability and accessibility [IMO]. <br />
<br />
Plus the user can choose the order of the prinicple content and navigation without needing to touch the CSS &#8211; very nice :)))<br />

<div class="comment-text"><strong>Mel:</strong> Very interesting comment!<br />
<br />
Content organised in the order I&#8217;ve suggested here is, in my opinion, the most sensible. It&#8217;s only potentially confusing because few sites have the option of considering source order &#8211; it requires quite a large mental shift for the developers to both CSS and semantic coding, but I don&#8217;t think that should count against it. Coupled with a proper heading structure (that&#8217;ll allow JAWS to construct a document outline) it ought to be &#8216;better&#8217; for all non-visual users. I include PDAs in that as well as search engine robots&#8230; <br />
<br />
That said, when testing with screen readers, the most annoying thing for me is having to continually skip through massive navigations to get to the meat of the page because I always end up over-shooting. I tend to skip to the end of the page and then work backwards&#8230; That behaviour would be interrupted by my front-loading approach.<br />
<br />
Hmmmm, it might be worth passing this one on to <a href="http://www.access-matters.com">Bob Easton</a> for discussion&#8230;</div>

<div class="comment-text">You are welcome Mike, good to finally be able to share and discuss the code and ideas behind these techniques. My <a href="http://www.severnsolutions.co.uk/twblog/archive/2004/07/01/cssnegativemarginsalgebra">first blog on negative margins</a> last summer has a few liquid/elastic examples &#8211; (although the rounding unit discussed in article is no longer required on the main crop of browsers &#8211; was predominantly for a bug in older Mozilla&#8217;s that is now fixed).<br />
The <a href="http://css.experiments.severnsolutions.co.uk/margins/elastic_fantastic/v1_final/">elastic fantastic</a> is a good demo also making use of unobtrusive javascript for the visuals rather than faux or other techniques.

I got 2 questions regarding classes in <em>tools.css</em>:<br />
<br />
1) What do you use <em>replace</em> class for in final work? <br />
<br />
2) Can you explain further the way you used the <em>clearfix method</em>? You used <code>display:inline-block;</code> property which is to stop IE/Mac to widen widthless floats to full width. But then you add <code>width:100%;</code> property. What is that selector <code>* html&gt;body .clearfix</code> Looks like a combo of <em>StarHtmlHack</em> with <em>BeNiceToOpera5</em>?<br />
<br />
Your code differs from original method, you linked to. What&#8217;s the point?</div>

<li class="even" id="comment-227">
<div class="comment-text">1) tools.css is assorted rules that I reuse on every project. replace is for image replacement, but isn&#8217;t relevent here. Replace it with your own favourite IR CSS, if you like. In case you&#8217;re interested, what&#8217;s there would be used in the HTML like this: <br />
<br />
&lt;h2 class="replace" id="some-heading"&gt;Some heading&lt;/h2&gt;<br />
<br />
2) * html>body .clearfix will feed the rule to IE/Mac only, since it obeys descendent selectors (way ahead of its time) but also follows the StarHtml filter, being the IE engine. It looks like the PIE article has been refined since I first grabbed the clearfix code but here&#8217;s the reasoning&#8230; <br />
<br />
IE/Mac can&#8217;t be forced to clear with the Holly Hack &#8211; it obeys height, unlike it&#8217;s PC counterparts, so it requires a different hack. Inline-blocks apparently expand vertically to contain their floats (like table cells, if I remember rightly), but we don&#8217;t want to shrink-wrap the block or it&#8217;ll cause the contained floats to stack vertically, hence the 100% width.<br />
<br />
Am I making sense?!</div>

<br />
Your explanation of inline-block property seems to make sense. Again, no chance for me to test it.<br />

<pre>
* html .clearfix {

This can cause serious problems, since the page might be very high, so in IE you might suddenly have 30px gaps in there. I recommend to replace that with 1px</div>

<div class="comment-text">Hi Mike,<br />
Modular css and your css framework are great!  But can someone help me in understanding the benefits of placing your navigation last in the mark-up?<br />
<br />
It seams to me that being able to navigate a website is more important than eliminating the &#8216;skip navigation&#8217; link.  When the main nav is in the bottom of the markup, it seems to me that <strong>finding</strong> the content that one wants to read becomes really difficult.  Maybe not for a blog I guess.  But even in a blog there should be a good means of navigating the archived information.  I feel that <strong>finding</strong> the information one looks for is the hard part about using the internet.<br />
<br />
So I have always assumed that placing navigation items at the top of the page is the only logical way to structure ones markup.  How many selections do people make before reaching a content item they want to read or hear?  More than enough to make up for a &#8220;skip navigation&#8221; link IMHO.<br />
<br />
But I would love to hear that I am wrong.  Because if I <strong>am</strong> wrong, I will use your css framework and make my life easy. :-)<br />
<br />
thanks again,<br />

<div class="comment-text">Actually, the core point of the article was to highlight the advantages of establishing a source template from which you can generate the majority of site designs. If you disagree with my source order then just switch it around! The only parts of the framework you&#8217;d have to change are the layout sheets, which are only a couple of dozen lines each&#8230; <br />
<br />
I think that your rationale for souce code order holds very well for a landing page &#8211; where people are likely to need navigation first and foremost, but once in browsing mode a nav-at-the-top order forces either repetitive reading of the navigation or reliance on skip links. People come to websites for their content and I want to make access to that as easy as possible. <br />

Have a read of &#8216;The Ideal Structure&#8217; section of the article and this reply to Mel further up in the comments.<br />

<div class="comment-text">Hi Mike,<br />
Thanks for your reply!<br />
I have read your article many times (along with it&#8217;s growing list of comments).  And Mel&#8217;s comment suggests that the navigation might be better at the top because of &#8216;familiarness&#8217;.  But I just wonder how much time is spent navigating one website and how much time is spent navigating the vast internet for meaningful content.  Will users without sight <strong>find</strong> content on a web site that they want to read/hear if the navigation follows the content (even in a &#8216;perfect world&#8217;)?  I just don&#8217;t know myself and that is the only reason I asked.<br />
<br />
Maybe it depends on the nature of the site.  Sites with a broad range of topics may benefit from a navigation-first approach.  And smaller sites with a more focused subject matter might be better off with the content first.<br />
<br />
At any rate, in the framework that I&#8217;ve made to speed up my own work (which has nothing to do with css apart from being able to slap new css files into it and linking to them in the db) I print the navigation first.  Your wonderful article has made me think about turning my framework into a little tableless-layout CMS by including css files that cover the layouts you&#8217;ve mentioned in your article.<br />
<br />
Any way it was inspiring to read and I thank you!<br />
And you hit an important nail on the head.  Clear as a bell.  And I hope Im not off-topic in my questioning your markup.<br />
<br />
I think, though, that I will probably keep the navigation at the top of the markup.<br />
<br />
I can see.  But I also don&#8217;t have a scroll-wheel on my mouse.  And I would surely be put off by a site that could fit all its content on my screen in order to save me having to ever scroll down the page constantly to read it, by putting the navigation at the bottom of the page.<br />
<br />
Hope that wasn&#8217;t too long a comment.<br />

Have a good one,<br />

<br />
That&#8217;s a fair point actually, although I use the same argument to justify placing my navigation at the bottom&#8230; If someone&#8217;s on my site they probably came through Google or from an inbound link so they are likely to be after my content, not my navigation. Thinking about it, I suppose that what I&#8217;m advocating is a kind of  <a href="http://www.powazek.com/2005/09/000540.html">Embrace Your Bottom</a> for screenreaders!<br />

I think you&#8217;re right about the nature of the site mattering though, and I like your no-mouse-wheel analogy &#8211; it&#8217;s a really interesting way of thinking of it. Anyway, it sounds like you&#8217;ve put plenty of thought into how you&#8217;re structuring your HTML and, for me anyway, that&#8217;s the most important thing.<br />

I think you could cut down on a few &#8220;display:inline&#8221; and &#8220;text-align&#8221; declarations though ;-)<br />
<br />
I&#8217;d say that links inside containers in these examples as well as some script to allow a switch of column length would be helpful. They could demonstrate real life behavior or bug. For example, the negative margin 3 column layout demo on <acronym title="A List Apart">ALA</acronym> fails to show issues with NN6 and Opera 6.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;ve done something a bit similar, but with fluid layouts:<br />

And I&#8217;ve used the negative margin technique the &#8220;other way around&#8221;:<br />

Not all these solutions rely on negative margins, but I must say they are very handy when the content comes first in the markup. I don&#8217;t know why you consider them as a hack though&#8230;<br />
<br />
Your question regarding the &#8220;be nice to Opera hack&#8221; contains my answer. I don&#8217;t like to &#8220;fork&#8221; inside a stylesheet to <strong>overwrite</strong> values. <br />
Make it red, no make it yellow, no make is red again&#8230; That does not make sense to me (without mentioning that most CSS filters rely on parsing <strong>bugs</strong>).<br />
<br />
IMHO, many more people would use CSS layouts today if &#8211; instead of wasting time &#8220;talking hacks&#8221; &#8211; discussions were about how elements flow and how to construct the box to avoid box model issues&#8230; <br />

<div class="comment-text">Thanks Thierry, let me try to find an answer to that:<br />
<br />
Negative margins are as much a hack as using selectors for overwriting values. They&#8217;re not really invalid, but they&#8217;re not intended to be used for this kindo stuff if U ask me. Especially if you consider that reading &#8220;margin-left: -200px&#8221; is as confusing as &#8217;&#8221;red, ehrm&#8230; no, green &#8230; no red&#8221;, to me at least.<br />
<br />
And sure, I don&#8217;t <strong>LIKE</strong> to apply hacks like <em>StarHtml</em> or <em>html>body</em>, but then again if it saves me the clearing divs you&#8217;re using in your 3-col layout I&#8217;ll do it, sinde it&#8217;ll keep presentational stuff where it belongs: inside of the CSS. <br />
Same goes for hacks in favour of Mac IE compatibility or any backwards compatible rendering.<br />
<br />
You might argue that <strong>IF</strong> everything worked fine everyone would &#8230; but that is not much more but bla bla since:<br />
a) various browsers have bugs that need to be dealt with<br />
b) you have to deal with designers that have their own ideas about how the site should look like, so you cannot design the layout around the markup<br />
c) you need as much research to get a good layout going hack-free and browser compatible as you would need to apply clearfix and such things. and they don&#8217;t make your html any better.<br />
<br />
I acknowledge what you&#8217;re trying to say, fo the the reasons above I tend to dismiss the last point you were trying to argue.</div>

You mentionned structural hacks in a previous comment, and you use it again here as an &#8220;excuse&#8221; for using CSS filters, but my layouts [1] [2] do <strong>not</strong> use presentational hacks. <br />
And IMHO, browsers bugs should not be an excuse either [3]. <br />

<div class="comment-text">Thierry &#8230; Just to summarize: Given that you don&#8217;t want to add structural markup you have two ways open which are CSS filters or negative margin based layouts &#8230; both in my eyes are hacks, in your eyes the filters are worse than the negative margins.

<div class="comment-text">I have been using the framework idea (seperating css files) for a while and have notices that occasionally when a page loads it skips a few css files randomly so you end up with an undesirable page.<br />
<br />
Ive noticed this in FF and IE it rarely happens and all you have to do is reload the page and the rest will get there but it does happen &#8211; so on that rare occasion someone will end up with a shocker page.<br />

Is this a problem with @import? or the browser skipping over files to speedup loading?<br />

Great work! Just a question, I&#8217;m playing with &#8220;Horizontal navigation with local navigation and one column of content&#8221; and I saw that the sub content is not displayed, but it&#8217;s in the html file and css (display: none;). If I delete it (or simply I leave it empty) I experience many problems, expecially with IE, for example the horizontal navigation disappear, or passing the mouse over one of the link in the left menu reduces the page, moving the footer to the top. Anyway with firefox and opera there are no problem, any idea how to solve it?<br />

<div class="comment-text">Thanks for css-framework.<br />

I was struggling with a similar idea to have a servlet-based code to populate pages as required.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of using the single column with the local-list and switch as required to 2-column and/or a single page as needed by the application.<br />
<br />
I have problems with IE6; fireFox is fine.<br />
<br />
The problems seem related to the div id=&#8221;sub&#8221;, unused in the layout-navtop-localleft.css that I am using to start the application.<br />
<br />
I have tried div id=&#8221;sub&#8221; class=&#8221;clearfix&#8221; and div class=&#8221;wrapper&#8221; without luck.<br />
<br />
Have a look at the referenced url.<br />

IE6 mangles or does not show the nav-row as well as repeting -entries in <br />

<div class="comment-text">I&#8217;m trying to get my head around merging the splendid Y!UI <a href="http://com2.devnet.scd.yahoo.com/yui/grids/">Grids</a> and this fabulous Framework (while leveraging the terrific <a href="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/Articles/12/modular-css">Modular CSS</a>) . With the Framework, the HTML order remains untouched though layouts require style sheet switching; with the Grids, the HTML requires parsing, but a single CSS file handles the layout. The Framework integrates semantics, the Grids offer more layouts. Maybe the Framework&#8217;s semantic goodness could be stitched to the Grids by adding a PHP function to the mix?<br />
<br />
I&#8217;m no programmer, so I apologize for this lame speculation. Each $page_layout could be associated with a multi-dimensional array, the outer array being the stacking order of named $yui_rows (of which there seem to be 10 flavours), and the inner array being the content file to include in each row&#8217;s divs. <br />
<br />
So the pseudocode arrays look like:<br />
<br />
default = ( <br />
  1/1 row => (banner),<br />
  1/1 row => (header),<br />
  1/4 3/4 row => (nav, content),<br />
  1/1 row => (footer)<br />
);<br />
home = (<br />
  1/1 row => (banner),<br />
  1/1 row => (header),<br />
  1/4 1/2 1/4 row => (nav, content, adverts),<br />
  1/1 row => (footer)<br />
);<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
So all HTML structure is contained within ten PHP files, one for each flavour of YUI row, and each row&#8217;s divs include a call to the function. You just assemble them like lego.</div>

Must confess, however, that I do sometimes hack the accessibility issue by using structured tables (with summary tags) and then just using &lt;div&gt; to float content to the top in the code, so that screen readers get content before navigation.<br />

If anyone fancies berating me for this workaround, please feel free, as I know I should be sticking to the more user-friendly and accessible website design methodology demonstrated here. <br />

I also have to confess that, although I keep templates handy, I do like coding on the fly. Handcoding is a really rewarding way of designing webpages, if only Dreamweaver and Photoshop junkies would give it a chance. It provides so much more control over important issues such as search engine friendly design, web accessibility and so forth.</div>

After the extract command I get an error message: &#8220;the file exists already, choose another name&#8221; [there are no such files at the same location] I get the same error no matter what other file name or location I specify. After this process, I get two empty folders CSS and I. What gives?<br />
Thanks</div>

<div class="comment-text">Great! I am trying to gather information on the various CSS frameworks around.

I am gonna do a redesign of my <a href="http://www.bubblexl.com">big balloon webshop</a> and I wonder if this framework would work for a webshop</div>

<div class="comment-text">A great resource, but I&rsquo;m curious as to why you didn&rsquo;t separate color styles into a separate skin stylesheet as outlined in your &ldquo;Modular CSS&rdquo; article??</div>

<div class="comment-text">I cant tell you how much this helps. I kept running into problems trying to position site elements using relative or absolute positioning. Now everything snaps together. Now only if I could figure out how to keep the header text from jumping out of the div block&#8230;</div>
